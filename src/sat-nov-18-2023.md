I studied mathematics for longer than I ever have in one day, I learned something intersting in how rudimentary calculus actually is.

I say rudimentary when I actually mean is fundamental to two other branches of mathematics namely statistics and linear algebra

as it turns out calculus is necessary in the study of statistics mainly in probability, when again I thought probability was just some rudiments for studying statistics when its a field that is on the same order as linear algebra and statistics

You often hear that the mathematics that you learn build on each other

This is how I thought the seqeunce on "should" learn common mathematics is ordered.

I slept on this and thought about how I can get to these higher level maths, is through other fields that may have a more or less gradual approach to these fields.

Such as business math, finanace, healthcare, biolology, physics, engineering, chemistry etc. I would like to see some pattern emerge some path or perculation then to map those skills to some actual resources such as books, videos or website links that I have.

Below I pose a query to gpt3, about how calculus and statistics are related or rather "intersect"

At what point does calculus intersect statistics?

Calculus and statistics intersect in several areas, and one key point of intersection is in probability theory. Probability theory, a branch of mathematics that deals with uncertainty and randomness, is fundamental to statistics. Calculus plays a crucial role in understanding and modeling probability distributions.

Here are some specific points where calculus and statistics intersect:

1. **Probability Density Functions (PDFs) and Cumulative Distribution Functions (CDFs):**

   - Probability density functions describe the likelihood of a continuous random variable taking a specific value. Calculus is used to define and work with probability density functions.
   - Cumulative distribution functions give the probability that a random variable is less than or equal to a certain value. Calculus is involved in finding cumulative distribution functions through integration.

2. **Expected Value and Variance:**

   - Calculus is used to compute the expected value (mean) and variance of a random variable. These are key measures in statistics that provide information about the central tendency and spread of a distribution.

3. **Limits and Convergence:**

   - Concepts from calculus, such as limits, are used in probability theory to describe the convergence of sequences of random variables. This is important in understanding the behavior of statistical estimators.

4. **Derivatives in Statistics:**

   - Derivatives are used in statistics for various purposes, such as finding the maximum likelihood estimates of parameters. Optimization techniques, which involve derivatives, play a crucial role in statistical modeling.

5. **Integration in Statistics:**

   - Integration is used in statistical inference, particularly in calculating probabilities associated with different events and in performing hypothesis tests.

6. **Regression Analysis:**

   - Regression analysis involves fitting a mathematical model to observed data. Calculus is used to find the parameters of the model that minimize the difference between the observed and predicted values.

7. **Stochastic Processes:**
   - Stochastic processes, which involve the evolution of random variables over time, often require the use of calculus for their analysis.

In summary, calculus and statistics are deeply interconnected, with calculus providing the mathematical tools needed to understand and work with the probabilistic concepts that underlie statistical analysis. The application of calculus in statistics is particularly evident in areas involving continuous random variables, probability distributions, and statistical modeling.

Here's output about calculus and linear algebra

Machine learning requires both statistics and linear algebra, and the importance of each depends on the specific area of machine learning and the task at hand. Both fields play crucial roles in different aspects of machine learning.

1. **Statistics:**

   - **Statistical Inference:** Understanding uncertainty, making predictions, and drawing conclusions from data are fundamental aspects of statistical inference. Concepts like probability distributions, hypothesis testing, and confidence intervals are essential for designing, evaluating, and interpreting machine learning models.
   - **Regression Analysis:** Many machine learning algorithms involve regression, where statistical techniques are used to model the relationships between variables and make predictions.
   - **Probability Theory:** Probability concepts are central to understanding the uncertainty associated with data and predictions. Bayesian methods, which rely heavily on probability theory, are used in some areas of machine learning.

2. **Linear Algebra:**
   - **Matrix Operations:** Linear algebra is fundamental in representing and manipulating data in the form of matrices. Operations such as matrix multiplication, inversion, and decomposition are extensively used in machine learning algorithms.
   - **Linear Transformations:** Many machine learning models involve linear transformations and manipulations of data. Techniques like principal component analysis (PCA) and linear regression heavily rely on linear algebra.
   - **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors:** Eigenvalues and eigenvectors play a role in various machine learning algorithms, particularly in dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA.
   - **Neural Networks:** In deep learning, which is a subset of machine learning, neural networks involve layers of interconnected nodes with weights. The training of neural networks, including backpropagation, is deeply rooted in linear algebra.

In practical terms, machine learning practitioners often need a strong foundation in both statistics and linear algebra to be effective. The combination of statistical knowledge for data analysis and modeling with linear algebra for efficient computation and manipulation of data structures provides a well-rounded skill set.

Additionally, as machine learning evolves, other mathematical and computational concepts, such as optimization, calculus, and probability theory, become important in specific areas of machine learning. Therefore, a multidisciplinary approach, combining knowledge from various mathematical disciplines, is often beneficial for understanding and working with machine learning algorithms effectively.
